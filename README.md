# Face_recog_MTECH
A ID card scanner was developed to tackle the ever-increasing queues at the library, canteens and main gate. An ESP-32 module camera module was used for achieving this task. Additionally, a face recognition software was also implemented for better accuracy and for clocking the in and out time of students.
